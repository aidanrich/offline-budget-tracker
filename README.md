# offline-budget-tracker

## Description
- We were asked to finish an app that tracks your budget, with an emphasis on offline functionality in case of use in poor connection areas.
- This app let's you keep track your budget with a simple interface and a helpful graph.
- This project helped us learn about IndexDB and service-worker.js.

## Installation
- You will need to use 'npm i' in a command line if you clone the app down from the repo. This will give you access to the packages needed to run this app.
- Github repo is here: https://github.com/aidanrich/offline-budget-tracker
## Usage
- You can use the live app on Heroku: https://aqueous-citadel-52972.herokuapp.com
- On the main page you can input an item with a corresponding dollar amount which you can either add or subtract from your total budget. When you hit submit you will see the item appear below and the graph will change to illustrate the change to your total budget.
